# beMoBi.PhaseSpace
A PhaseSpace motion capture system integration for the beMoBi Framework

This Asset consits of two main components.

## The OWL Interface
It's a abstraction of the actual Phasespace API to simplify to use of the Phasespace API within the Unity Editor and the Runtime.

## Benchmark
Actually a pre-Alpha idea of an benchmark for different Impulse (Phasespace Hardware) Setups.

## Dependencies
To use the components you need access to the PhaseSpace API. Therefore, you need to get in contact with the Phasespace Support.
